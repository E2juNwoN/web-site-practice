        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#cite_note-1"><strong> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#cite_note-2">CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#cite_note-3">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.</a>
        This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
